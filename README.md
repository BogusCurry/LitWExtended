# LitWExtended
The Gronkh's Life in the Woods bug tracker page.

Here you can post bugs or other unintended behaviour of the Life in the Woods Extended Modpack or the Server Modpack,
which is aviable here: http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/litw-extended.929330

Just open an issue if you found a bug or something like that, I will take a look at it.

Issue Submission Guidelines:
> The bug must be reproducable. I'll explain this point in a more detailed way later in this document.
> If it's a graphical bug, provide a screenshot.
> If it's any other bug, provide a good description of what you done before it happened (If you can do
that, a video would also be nice). This step is very important.
> Please use English language when reporting bugs. Even though I speak German too, it can be helpful to
others who have the same issue and are trying to solve it, but don't speak German.
> Please check if your issue has already been reported earlier. That's what search functions are for.

Please make sure the bug you report can be reproduced in a clean install of the modpack,
what means that you should remove all mods you added to the pack and reset all the configs you
changed to the defaults I provide. If you are not sure what this means, it's very likely that
you didn't change anything. If that's the case, you are free to report your issue.
